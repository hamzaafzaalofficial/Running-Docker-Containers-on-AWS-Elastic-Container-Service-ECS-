Build the Docker image using the following command:
If you want to use any specific docker image, you can specify your own for this task. 

# 2. Configure ECS Cluster
Creating a basic ECS Cluster & select AWS Fargate as infrastructure. 

# 3. Create an ECS Task Definition
Define the task definition that describes your container and its resources.

Define the desired number of tasks to run.
Configure the service with load balancing if needed (e.g., Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer). 
This step is crucial for running the task that is defined in the previous step.
